# Project Name: Mobile First

**Author**: Noah, Earl Jay
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We want to create a website that is responsive to both mobile and desktop views. We want to replicate the formatting and styling of the starter code.

## Getting Started
In order to have a site responsive to both mobile and desktop views, the user should first, focus on how to style the mobile version. In order to make the page responsive, the user will have to setup a media query with a specified breakpoint so that the document knows to change from one view to the other. In our project, we used breakpoints of min-width and max-width. We styled and formatted our elements within these breakpoints according to the mobile design, first. Then, once finished, styled our desktop elements according to their respective breakpoints.

## Architecture
This application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The starting code contained a icons.css file. We added normalize.css, base.css, layout.css, and module.css. An .eslintrc and .gitignore file were included as standard files for all applications.
